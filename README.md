# Whack-A-Vue

> NOTE: This project is still a WIP (Work In Progress)

<https://whackavue.netlify.app/>

## Project Overview

This project is just for learning, fun, and honing my skills.
It uses Vue.js and TailwindCSS.

It's based off the arcade game called **Whack-A-Mole**.
I thought it would be interesting to try to build a game-like experience using
Vue.

## The Game

The game begins by the timer starting. You have 10 seconds to whack (click on) as many
Vue logos as you can.

You know you have successfully whacked a logo by it receding away.

When time is up after 10 seconds, the user recieves a score based on the number
of whacks they made.
